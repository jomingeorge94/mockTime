Web-based mock examination systems are used within educational institutions, to help students prepare for their exams. 
In addition, it is a way for the examiner to analyse and gather statistics on student knowledge. 
This could be seen as a way for lecturers and students to interact with each other and to be able to build a stronger understanding in the contents that have been delivered throughout formal teaching. 
With the use of an online mock examination system, it will be easier for the lecturer to add or modify any questions that they believe is related to the content that a student should familiarise themselves with, in preparation for an exam. 
MockTime provides a complete online mock examination system, which was produced as a result of findings showing the shortcomings of other available systems; it provides an interactive interface to both the examiner and student in managing and reviewing the examination. 
It was found that most examiners found the interactive statistics extremely useful in gauging student progress within a module; furthermore, students tended to prefer using MockTime rather than other currently available examination systems.
